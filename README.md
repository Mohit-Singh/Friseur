> * Install create react app utility -
  `npm i create-react-app`

> * Clone the repository
> * Run `npm install`

## Some points to consider while working with `npm` modules
> * Prefereably use `--save` while installing any package for your project.
> * Use -g if you want to install package globally.
> * Do not use `--save` if you are installing module only for testing purpose.

## Project architecture
> * `index.js` is the entry point of your react.
> * `index.html` in public folder is the entry point for your application.  You can change this url in manifest.json
> * HTML attribute `class` is used as `className`

## Naming cocnvention

> * File names -`pascal casing`
> * Folder names - `pascal casing` for example - `Assets/User/Img`
> * Global variable names - \
